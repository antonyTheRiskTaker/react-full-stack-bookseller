      <h1>Purpose of this bookselling shop</h1>
      <p>This online is dedicated to selling old books I bought during my stay in the UK to help the war efforts in Ukraine. All proceeds from the book sales, minus all the necessary costs of making deliveries, payment processing and other necessary spending associated, will be wired to the HK bank account of the National Bank of Ukraine.</p>
